# Mathbase
> Math as Adventure or: Math in 5 Minutes - from Students for Students

This application has been developed in the course of a project seminar at the Apian high school in Ingolstadt, Germany. The goal is to provide a simple and precise management of manifold mathematical topics that have been worked out and media designed by students for students, exempli gratia in the form of videos, worksheets and visuals. This digital collection can be easily extended by other classes, seminars or dedicated teachers, too.

## Releases
At [releases](../../releases/), all program versions are to be found.

## System Requirements
To execute the application, Java respectively the [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://java.com/de/download/manual.jsp) version 1.8 or above must be installed on the executing system. Provided that this condition is met, Mathbase can be run at least on the following operating systems:

* Windows Vista and above
* MacOS X and above
* Linux (desktop distributions)

On the [official Java website](https://java.com/en/download/help/sysreq.xml), the full system requirements can be checked.

ATTENTION: As of Java Version 11, JavaFX is not a part of JRE anymore and therefore you have to install [OpenJFX](https://openjfx.io/) as well!

## Installation
For the purpose of installing it is sufficient to download the file `Mathbase.jar` of a specific [version](../../releases) into the desired directory and, depending on the desktop environment, subsequently starting it either by a double-click or by submitting the command `java -jar Mathbase.jar` from the command line.

## Error Handling
During operation, Mathbase automatically generates a file named `log.txt` in the execution directory which contains a record of the program flow. In case of problems with the application, a glimpse into this logfile usually reveals detailed information on the course of events that led to the error.
